## DECISION (COSTS)

### [1]
In March 2007 the plaintiff initiated proceedings against the defendant, claiming that the defendant had infringed the Privacy Act 1993 (‘the Act') by collecting information about him from a third party in breach of Privacy Principle 2. The proceedings were served, and a full statement of reply was filed on 20 April 2007. A telephone conference took place on 1 June 2007, and a timetable was agreed for an exchange of evidence. Before any statements of evidence were filed, however, the plaintiff discontinued the claim on 20 June 2007.

### [2]
The defendant asks us to make an award of costs in its favour under s.85(2) of the Act. We are informed that its costs in connection with the matter have come to $3,464.90, which figure includes $843.75 relating to the application for costs itself. We are invited to fix costs against the defendant for the full amount of $3,464.90 on the basis that:
[a] The plaintiff failed to contact the defendant directly in order to see if matters could be resolved before the proceedings were taken;

*Citation: statute - s.85(2) of the Act*

[b] The plaintiff failed to consider the defendant's written explanation (which was provided before the proceedings were commenced in the Tribunal) about what had happened;
[c] The plaintiff did not accept two opinions written by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, both of which were to the effect that the defendant was entitled to rely on the exceptions to Principle 2, with a result that there had been no breach of the Privacy Act.

### [3]
In short, the defendant asks us to accept that the claim ought never to have been commenced, and to reflect that conclusion by way of a full indemnity award against the plaintiff. Mr France has drawn our attention to the principles relating to costs in cases in this Tribunal in Herron v Spiers Group Limited <sup>[2006]</sup> NZHRRT 29 (4 August 2006), and notes that in Horne v Bryant <sup>[2003]</sup> NZHRRT 36 (18 December 2003) the Tribunal commented that, where a plaintiff effectively abandons his or her claim on the eve of a hearing, the starting point should be that the defendant is entitled to an appropriate award of costs.

### [4]
We have some sympathy for the defendant's position. On the information that is available to us, the plaintiff seems to have been determined to issue his proceedings in the Tribunal irrespective of the outcome of the Privacy Commissioner's opinion. There is in this case an element of what concerned the Tribunal in Ram v KMart New Zealand [2003] NZHRRT 27 (6 August 2003) when it said:

> **Ram v KMart New Zealand [2003] NZHRRT 27 (6 August 2003)**
>
> urge those who are aggrieved by the outcome of the Privacy Commissioner's investigation and who wish to come to the Tribunal for a hearing, to recognise that when they do so there is inevitably a risk that costs may be awarded against them if their claim does not succeed. Although the Tribunal is not obliged to accept the opinion given by the Privacy Commissioner in any case, it ought to be obvious to such litigants that when their case comes to the Tribunal they will need to be prepared to deal with any adverse opinion by the Privacy Commissioner. To approach litigation in the Tribunal on the basis that the substantive matters raised in the Privacy Commissioner' opinion can simply be ignored is extremely unwise.” (at para 55).

### [5]
We certainly agree with the defendant that it is entitled to an appropriate award of costs, and we reject the plaintiff's argument that costs ought to be left to lie where they have fallen. But we do not think it is appropriate to award costs on a full indemnity basis. We note:
[a] The plaintiff says in effect that it was not until he was briefing his evidence that he was able to establish, in a way that he accepted, how the information at issue had come to the defendant. Prior to that he had been led by a third party to believe that the information at issue had not been passed by it to the defendant. That had given him reason to doubt the account of events offered by the defendant. But then after the claim was commenced, the third party had written to tell the plaintiff that its earlier advice had been wrong. A further search of records had established that it (the third party) was the source of the information that the defendant had received about the plaintiff after all;
[b] We accept that the plaintiff issued the proceedings in good faith, in the sense that he genuinely believed that the account of events that had been offered by the defendant was incorrect. It does not follow that he was obviously right to issue the proceedings: the Privacy Commissioner's opinions had been to the effect that there was no breach of the Privacy Act irrespective of whether the identity of the source of the information was known or not. But the point is that this is not a case in which the plaintiff has simply refused to accept incontrovertible facts; we are willing to accept that when he issued the proceedings he held the view that his claim did have some prospect of success;
[c] Furthermore we think it is clear that the plaintiff did the responsible thing to discontinue the claim as soon as it became clear to him that the factual situation was not as he had expected. As a result the defendant was not put to the expense of preparing evidence or readying itself for a hearing. The situation is not the same as one in which a plaintiff simply abandons a case on the eve of the hearing as in Horne v Bryant (supra - we also note that even in Horne v Bryant the Tribunal was not persuaded to award full indemnity costs). Indeed we think that a decision to award full solicitor/client costs in this case might set a counter-productive precedent; the wider interests of justice are against adopting an approach that might discourage others from acting responsibly to end a claim when it becomes clear to them that it no longer has any prospect of success.

*Citation: case - Horne v Bryant (supra)*

### [6]
For these reasons we are not persuaded to make an award of costs on a full solicitor/client indemnity basis.

### [7]
This case has, in the end, been dealt with without the need for any viva voce hearing. The defendant was obliged to prepare a reply to the statement of claim, and its counsel attended one case management telephone conference. No doubt there has been some incidental correspondence as well, and costs have been incurred in preparing the application for costs. In the circumstances, we take the recent decision in Moulton v Auckland Regional Council <sup>[2007]</sup> NZHRRT 2 (12 February 2007), and the cases there collected, as a useful reference point.

*Citation: case - Moulton v Auckland Regional Council [2007] NZHRRT 2 (12 February 2007)*

### [8]
In our assessment it is appropriate to fix costs in favour of the defendant in this case at $1,000.00. The figure is 'all in' – that is, it is intended to encompass all costs and disbursements, and it incorporates the costs attributed to the application for costs as well. We make our award pursuant to s.85(2) of the Act accordingly.
