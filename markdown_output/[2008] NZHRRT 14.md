## DECISION (COSTS ON INTERLOCUTORY ISSUES)

### [1]
The plaintiff (‘the Director’) has applied for an order that the defendant be ordered to pay costs at this stage of the litigation, even though the case has not yet reached the stage of a hearing on the substantive issues. The application is opposed.

### [2]
In order to deal with the matter, some information about the procedural history of the case is required.

### [3]
The Director's claim and the defendant's reply were filed in June and July 2007 respectively. The first case management telephone conference then took place on 15 August 2007. A timetable was agreed which, if it had been achieved, would have seen the substantive hearing take place from 11 February 2008. Subsequently the parties sought a variation of the timetable, with a new fixture to be arranged at any time after 24 March 2008. Those variations were made by consent.

### [4]
As a result of the agreed variation to the timetable orders, the Secretary of the Tribunal was asked to liaise with counsel to arrange a new date for the hearing. The result of that process was that, on 25 September 2007, the matter was set down for a hearing to take place in Tauranga starting on 31 March 2008.

### [5]
On 1 November 2007 the defendant filed an application for non-party discovery against the Lakes District Health Board: see Director of Human Rights Proceedings v Bay of Plenty District Health Board (Non Party Discovery Issues) <sup>[2008]</sup> NZHHRT 13. However it was not served on the non-party at the same time. Regrettably an indication by the Chairperson of the Tribunal that it should be served on the non-party was not conveyed to the defendant. The net result was that the application was not progressed at all in the period after it was filed and before counsel for the defendant contacted the Secretary of the Tribunal on 26 February 2008 to ask what progress had been made in respect of the application.

### [6]
Memoranda subsequently filed on behalf of the Director and for the defendant make it clear that there were efforts after 26 February 2008 to try to resolve the issue, so that it would not be necessary to ask the Tribunal to make a formal order requiring non-party discovery by Lakes District Health Board. The attempts to deal with the matter in that way were not entirely successful but some progress was made - to the extent that, on 17 March 2008, counsel for the defendant was able to file an amended application for non-party discovery that was very much more specific in its terms than the first application had been.

### [7]
However by 17 March 2008 there was also a new issue as to whether the defendant could file a statement of evidence relating to the question of harm suffered by the complainant. The statement of evidence would by then have had to be filed outside the time-limits that had been agreed to in September 2007.

### [8]
There was a case management telephone conference on 26 March 2008. It was made clear that the issues relating to non-party discovery had not been resolved to the satisfaction of the defendant. By then a draft brief of the proposed extra evidence had been provided to the Director. The defendant sought leave to adduce the evidence at the hearing, but the Director opposed the suggestion. It was his position that the additional evidence ought not be received because its filing did not comply with the earlier time-table orders. It was further suggested that the Director would be seeking an award of costs against the defendant if the substantive hearing – which at that time was till set for 31 March 2008 – were to have to be postponed.

### [9]
For reasons given by the Chairperson in his minute of the telephone conference on 26 March 2008, the hearing that was to have taken place on 31 March 2008 was vacated. A new timetable was set. It included an opportunity for the Director to file evidence in answer to that which had been proposed by the defendant (and to which the Director had objected).

### [10]
The substantive hearing was then set down to start on Monday, 19 May 2008.

### [11]
After the telephone conference on 26 March 2008 it emerged, however, that one of the proposed witnesses for the defendant would not be available in New Zealand between 12 May 2008 and 3 June 2008. That gave rise to further correspondence and memoranda as to whether the Tribunal should take the the relevant evidence in advance, and thus retain the substantive fixture set for 19 May 2008.

### [12]
After submissions had been received, on 4 April 2008 the Chairperson vacated the 19 May 2008 hearing. Regrettably, having regard to other fixtures in the Tribunal and counsels' various commitments, it was not then possible to contemplate a fixture before early August 2008. Again, the Secretary of the Tribunal was asked to contact counsel to discuss specific arrangements.

### [13]
The case is now set down to be heard on 4, 5 and 6 August 2008.

### [14]
Against this background, the Director submits that the defendant's conduct warrants an award of costs against the defendant at this stage of the proceedings. Specifically, the Director submits:

#### [a]
The defendant failed to prosecute the non-party discovery application that was originally filed in November 2007 as it ought to have done;

#### [b]
The defendant's solicitors did not respond to correspondence concerning the relevance of the documents at issue in an appropriate or timely way;

#### [c]
The defendant failed to appreciate that the Director appears as plaintiff in his own capacity, and that while he is putting forward a case relating to the complainant, he does not act for the complainant and so does does not have the same ability that counsel for a party would have to see that discovery is properly given by the complainant;

#### [d]
The extra brief of evidence which the defendant indicated it wished to file outside the agreed timetable orders has contributed to circumstances in which the Chairperson had no choice but to adjourn the fixtures.

### [15]
Submissions for the defendant take issue with some of the assertions made on behalf of the Director as to the content and consequences of the correspondence relating to non-party discovery. Counsel for the defendant accepts that the Director may not be acting for the complainant in any formal sense. Nonetheless they describe it as being absurd that, in all the circumstances, the Director considers that he does not have any obligation to make available information that is held by the complainant and that is relevant to the allegations that are being put forward on behalf of the complainant by the Director. With respect to the issue of the extra brief of evidence, it is argued that the need for that brief only emerged once the defendant had had an opportunity to consider the briefs of evidence filed by the Director. It is further submitted for the defendant that:

#### [a]
It was necessary to file and prosecute the application for non- party discovery in order for the defendant to be satisfied that the discovery process had been completely attended to before the substantive hearing began, and the Tribunal ought not to award costs against the defendant for doing so;

#### [b]
The issues in relation to discovery were raised by the defendant in good faith, and not simply to be obstructive to the Director in his pursuit of the claim;

#### [c]
In any event, the role of the Office of Human Rights Proceedings in this case is as a governmental agency that has responsibility for bringing cases that are deemed to have merit. The Director ought not to be entitled to costs on the basis that a proceeding has to be adjourned if the reason for adjourning the proceeding is related to the pursuit of relevant discovery.

### [16]
The decision in Smith v Air New Zealand <sup>[2003]</sup> NZHRRT 23 concerns a somewhat similar situation. On that occasion the Tribunal awarded the sum of $1500 to the defendant because of the way in which the plaintiff (there represented by the Director) had attended to issues of discovery. In doing so, however, the Tribunal made it clear that the award was to stand to the credit of the defendant, but would not become payable until a final decision regarding costs was made after the substantive hearing had taken place.

*Citation: case - Smith v Air New Zealand [2003] NZHRRT 23*

### [17]
We agree with the Director that the application for non-party discovery should have been served on the non-party at the time that it was first filed. We also agree that the defendant should have prosecuted that matter more diligently than it did. And, although the delay might have been avoided had the Chairperson's indication that service was expected been conveyed to the defendant, we do not regard that as excusing the defendant's management of the issue. It can hardly be suggested that it would ever be appropriate for the Tribunal to make an order for non-party discovery without first giving the non-party an opportunity to be heard.

### [18]
Furthermore, given the way in which the matter has subsequently unfolded, it does seem reasonably clear that if the non-party discovery application had been prosecuted in November 2007, then the issue of discovery - which was a significant contributing factor to the need to adjourn the proposed 31 March 2008 fixture - would have been avoided. We accept that the initiative to have non-party discovery was advanced by the defendant in good faith, but in our view it could, and should, have been attended to earlier than it was.

### [19]
The timetable that was agreed in September 2007 contemplated that the evidence to be called by the Director would be filed and served by 7 December 2007. There is no suggestion by the defendant that the Director did not substantially achieve that deadline. It follows that the defendant was in a position in early December 2007 to evaluate the Director's evidence, and to recognise the potential need to file its own expert evidence on the question of harm suffered by the complainant.

### [20]
In the circumstances, we cannot see how it assists the defendant to say that it was only upon review of the plaintiff's evidence that it was realised that expert evidence would be required on the defendant's side. It is not at all clear to us why the expert evidence could not have been prepared by 31 January 2008, which was the agreed deadline for filing of evidence by the defendant.

### [21]
For these reasons we find that the defendant's failure to prosecute the non-party discovery application expeditiously, and its failure to comply with the agreed timetable for exchange of evidence in advance of the hearing, were the substantive reasons for the fact that the originally scheduled hearing had to be postponed.

### [22]
Even so, we have some difficulty in knowing how to respond to the Director's application. The Director has not suggested what the amount of any award should be. We have no information about what extra expenses have been incurred by the Director in order to meet the situation caused by the defendant's conduct of the matter. While we accept that the Director will have expended additional time in dealing with the case, it is difficult to assess what that should mean in terms of the quantum of any costs to be awarded, particularly where (as the defendant observes) the Director is bringing the case effectively as a self-representing plaintiff whose statutory responsibility it is to put cases of this kind forward. It would be different if there were (for example) a claim for cancelled airfares, or unnecessary accommodation expenses and the like. But there is no such claim here.

### [23]
In our view, the appropriate way to deal with the Director's application for costs is as follows:

*Citation: case - Smith v Air New Zealand Ltd (supra)*

#### [a]
We recognise that the Director has been required to spend more time dealing with the matter than he might have been expected to have to spent on it if the defendant had complied with the agreed timetable arrangements and/or had advanced its non- party discovery application more diligently;

#### [b]
However we do not yet have enough information to assess whether or to what extent the extra time taken by the Director in the matter has imposed extra costs upon him for which the defendant should be required to compensate him;

#### [c]
Adopting broadly the same approach as was taken in Smith v Air New Zealand Ltd (supra) we are in any event inclined to the view that, even if costs could be quantified at this stage, any award in favour of the Director at this point should probably be left to stand to his credit in the final analysis but that it should not actually become payable by the defendant to the Director until the final result of the litigation is known;

#### [d]
In the circumstances, the assessment of the quantum of any award in favour of the Director should be reserved until the substantive proceedings have been determined, and issues of costs generally are ready to be dealt with

### [24]
For these reasons, and although we accept that the Director has established grounds that would justify an award of costs, we reserve quantification of any such award. The topic will be revisited if and when the issue of costs generally is assessed after the substantive hearing has been completed.
