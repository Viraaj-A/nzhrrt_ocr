## DECISION OF TRIBUNAL

### [1]
Peter Thomas is married to Lee-Ann Pikiora Hawe-Thomas (Ms Hawe). Ms Hawe was investigated by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) regarding her entitlement to certain benefits. In the course of that investigation MSD sent letters to various third

parties, seeking information about Ms Hawe, Mr Thomas and Peter Thomas Transport Ltd.2

### [2]
Mr Thomas' complaint relates to MSD's sending of those letters, seeking information about him from third parties.

## BACKGROUND

### [3]
In 2012 MSD received information that Ms Hawe and Mr Thomas were married or in a relationship in the nature of marriage, despite Ms Hawe receiving benefits as a single person. Accordingly, MSD commenced an investigation into whether Ms Hawe was entitled to those benefits. The investigation included issuing over twenty five individual notices (Notices) seeking information from a range of organisations and agencies between 22 June 2012 and 11 June 2013.3 Annexure One to this decision contains more detail about those Notices.4

### [4]
The first Notice which the Tribunal had a copy of was sent to Westpac Bank on 11 July 2012. It referred to both Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe under the descriptions of "client name" and "client number". It stated:

I am writing to you about the above named.

To make sure we make the right payments when people are receiving a benefit, we need to check some of the details they have provided.

I am looking to you to help me with information.

Enclosed is a notice that clarifies legal issues and obligations that you have under our social welfare laws. This notice is approved by the Privacy Commissioner and means we meet our legal responsibilities.

I would appreciate it if you could treat this matter in confidence and send your response directly to me at the address provided below before 21 July 2012.

### [5]
On 28 November 2012 MSD interviewed Ms Hawe. MSD internal file notes record that during the interview Ms Hawe stated that Mr Thomas lived in Patea, Taranaki. There is no record that Ms Hawe gave any street address for Mr Thomas.

### [6]
On 29 November 2012, MSD wrote a letter to Mr Thomas addressed to him at 221 Egmont Street, Patea seeking detailed financial information and allowing him 5 working days to respond. The letter advised Mr Thomas that MSD had received information that may affect Ms Hawe's benefit entitlement, namely that he and Ms Hawe

were married and had been living in a relationship in the nature of marriage. The letter said that MSD was looking into Ms Hawe's past and present entitlement to benefits.5

### [7]
Between 14 December 2012 and 14 January 2013 MSD issued five further Notices to third parties seeking information about Mr Thomas (sometimes as well as Ms Hawe and Peter Thomas Transport Ltd).

### [8]
On 15 January 2013 MSD received a phone call from Morrison Creed Advisory Ltd (Mr Thomas' accountants) in which MSD was advised that Ms Hawe was not employed by Peter Thomas Transport Ltd and that Mr Thomas was not happy about providing any information.

### [9]
On 1 February 2013 and 19 March 2013 MSD issued two additional Notices seeking further information about Mr Thomas.

### [10]
MSD's records then show that on 6 May 2013:

#### [10.1]
MSD sent a letter to Mr Thomas at Kew Street, Taupo asking for him to contact MSD by 17 May 2013 to discuss his relationship with Ms Hawe. That letter referred to MSD's earlier letter of 29 November 2012, which had been sent to 221 Egmont Street, Patea.

#### [10.2]
Another Notice was issued seeking information about Mr Thomas.

### [11]
Notwithstanding the request to Mr Thomas in the letter of 6 May 2013 (to contact MSD by 17 May 2013), on 7 May 2013 MSD issued a further eight Notices to third parties seeking information about Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe.

### [12]
MSD records also show that on 17 May 2013 Mr Thomas contacted MSD (as requested) and in a voicemail message he stated, amongst other things, that he noticed MSD had said that it sent him a letter on 29 November 2012 to which he had not replied and that MSD had the wrong address (Kew Street not Kew Place).

### [13]
The investigation was subsequently closed, and the matter went to prosecution. This claim is, however, not about the prosecution, but only about the alleged interference with Mr Thomas' privacy by MSD in the course of gathering information.

### [14]
In summary, of the twelve Notices which the Tribunal had copies of:

#### [14.1]
Each Notice started by identifying one or more of Mr Thomas, Ms Hawe and Peter Thomas Transport Ltd as the subjects or “client(s)" and then said MSD was writing about the person(s) identified as the “client(s)”, saying “To make sure

we make the right payments when people are receiving a benefit, we need to check some of the details they have provided.”

#### [14.2]
Each Notice required the response to be made to the National Fraud Investigation Unit of MSD and that the recipient was to treat the matter in confidence.

#### [14.3]
In three of the Notices Mr Thomas alone was identified as the subject or "client".

### [15]
Mr Thomas complained to the Privacy Commissioner (Commissioner) about the alleged interference with his privacy arising from the issue of the Notices. The Commissioner's certificate, confirming his investigation, was issued on 29 November 2017.

## THE CLAIM

### [16]
Mr Thomas claims that in sending the Notices MSD breached information privacy principles (IPPs) 1, 2, 4 and the Code of Conduct.6 He says those breaches constitute an interference with his privacy. He seeks general damages for the interference with his privacy in a sum to be fixed by the Tribunal, exemplary damages, and costs.7

### [17]
MSD denies breaching IPPs 1 and 4. MSD says that IPP 2 is codified in the Code of Conduct. MSD accepts that for Notices issued prior to 29 November 2012 it breached that Code of Conduct in that it did not first request information from Mr Thomas before going to other parties for that information.8 However, it says that:

#### [17.1]
Irrespective of when the Notices were issued there has been no interference with Mr Thomas' privacy, as any breaches of the IPPs or the Code of Conduct have not caused him significant harm.

#### [17.2]
Mr Thomas has not established any pecuniary or other loss.

#### [17.3]
There is no causal link between its actions and Mr Thomas' alleged other losses.

#### [17.4]
If damages are to be awarded, they will need to be discounted for Mr Thomas' contributing conduct, namely his conviction for dishonestly using a document in 2014.

## ISSUES

### [18]
The issues requiring determination in this proceeding are:

#### IPP 1: Purpose of Collection of Information
[18.1] Whether MSD, in collecting information about Mr Thomas, did so for a lawful purpose connected with a function or activity of MSD; and

[18.2] If so, whether the collection of the information was necessary for that purpose.

#### Code of Conduct and IPP 2: Source of Personal Information
[18.3] Whether MSD requested information from Mr Thomas before issuing the Notices after 29 November 2012.

#### IPP 4: Manner of Collection of Personal Information
[18.4] Whether MSD collected Mr Thomas' personal information by unlawful means.

[18.5] Whether MSD collected Mr Thomas' personal information by means that were either unfair or intruded to an unreasonable extent upon his personal affairs, in the circumstances of this case.

#### Interference with Privacy
[18.6] If MSD has collected information in breach of IPP 1, failed to comply with IPP 2 or the Code of Conduct or collected information in breach of IPP 4, whether there has been there been an interference with Mr Thomas' privacy.

#### Remedy
[18.7] If there has been an interference with Mr Thomas' privacy, what (if any) is the appropriate remedy?

## IPP 1: PURPOSE OF COLLECTION OF INFORMATION



#### The Law
### [19]
IPP 1 provides:

> **Information privacy principle 1**
>
> Purpose of collection of personal information
>
> (1) Personal information shall not be collected by any agency unless –
>
> (a) the information is collected for a lawful purpose in connection with a function or an activity of the agency; and
>
> (b) the collection of the information is necessary for that purpose.
>

### [20]
The phrase “necessary for that purpose” means reasonably necessary.9

*Citation: case - Lehmann v Canwest Radio Works Ltd [2007] NZHRRT 35 at [50]; Citation: case - Tan v New Zealand Police [2016] NZHRRT 32 at [77]-[78]*



#### Whether MSD Collected Information About Mr Thomas for a Lawful Purpose
### [21]
MSD submitted that the collection was for a lawful purpose. The submission was that the information requested about Mr Thomas was required for the investigation of Mr Hawe, given that MSD had received information that Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe were married or were in a relationship in the nature of marriage. Mr Thomas did not specifically address the Tribunal as to that.

### [22]
MSD has wide powers to obtain personal information for a range of purposes, including the investigation into benefit entitlement, under s 11 of the Social Security Act 1964 (SS Act). Section 11 states that any person may be required to provide, without charge and within five days of a written request, any information, documents, or records to enable the Chief Executive of MSD to:

*Citation: statute - s 11 of the Social Security Act 1964 (SS Act)*

### [23]
Accordingly, the collection of information about Mr Thomas which was for the investigation into benefits payable to Ms Hawe was for a lawful purpose. It was also connected with a function of MSD, namely the administration of the SS Act.

*Citation: statute - SS Act*



#### Whether Collection was Necessary for that Purpose
### [24]
MSD submits that the requests were not unduly broad, nor did they target highly personal information, the implication (as we understand it) being that they were necessary for that purpose.

### [25]
The information sought in those Notices which were available to the Tribunal does generally appear to be confined to information which would be relevant to the determination of whether Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe were in a relationship in the nature of marriage.11

### [26]
We do not accept however that the information sought by MSD in its Notices of 14 January 2013 and 19 March 2013 to ACC, both of which refer only to Mr Thomas in the subject heading and in the Notice sent to Westpac on 6 May 2013, again also referring only to Mr Thomas, was necessary to determine the status of Ms Hawe's and Mr Thomas' relationship.

### [27]
There is, accordingly, a breach of IPP 1 as some of the information sought to be collected was not necessary for the purpose of the investigation into benefits properly payable to Ms Hawe.

## CODE OF CONDUCT AND IPP 2: SOURCE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION



#### The Code of Conduct and the Privacy Act
### [28]
IPP 2 deals with the source and collection of personal information and provides that (with certain exceptions) where an agency collects personal information, the agency shall collect that information directly from the individual concerned.

### [29]
The collection of information is also specifically authorised under the SS Act. Section 11 empowers the Chief Executive of MSD to require any person to provide MSD with such information as the Chief Executive requires, to produce any document in the custody or under the control of that person and to furnish copies or extracts from any document, for any of the purposes specified in s 11(2).

*Citation: statute - SS Act; Citation: statute - Section 11*

### [30]
As this power conferred by s 11 of the SS Act must be balanced with duties governing the way in which such power is to be exercised, s 11B imposes on the Chief Executive the requirement to issue a Code of Conduct governing the obtaining of information.12

*Citation: statute - s 11 of the SS Act; Citation: statute - s 11B*

### [31]
Clause 8.1 of the Code of Conduct provides:

> **Clause 8.1 of the Code of Conduct**
>
> Except where expressly overridden by this Code or by the Act, the Information Privacy Principles set out in section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 apply to all information collected stored or used by the department under this Code.

### [32]
While the starting point is that MSD must comply with the IPPs, those IPPs are not breached if the action is authorised or required by the SS Act.13

*Citation: statute - SS Act*

### [33]
This is clarified in Appendix A of the Code of Conduct which specifically states in the explanatory note that “Where MSD is given special statutory powers to obtain information, these powers override the Privacy Act". The Appendix also provides an example:14

> **Appendix A of the Code of Conduct**
>
> The Information Privacy Principles ... apply to almost all agencies and their handling of personal information. The department must comply with these principles.
> 
> This means for example that information must not be collected by unfair or unlawful means (IPP4), must be stored safely and securely (IPP5), must be accurate and up to date (IPP8). However, some aspects of the code override the information privacy principles. For example, the power to obtain information from a third party overrides IPP2...

### [34]
Accordingly, where the Code of Conduct is inconsistent with the IPPs, the Code of Conduct takes precedence, but otherwise the IPPs continue to apply to MSD's actions. Actions not authorised by the Code of Conduct could be breaches of the IPPs.15

### [35]
The Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider an alleged breach of the Code of Conduct is addressed by s 11B(6) and (7) of the SS Act.16

*Citation: statute - s 11B(6) and (7) of the SS Act*



#### Operation of the Code of Conduct
### [36]
The Code of Conduct set out the steps required when seeking information about any person, as follows:

### [37]
MSD has conceded that, in respect of Notices issued before 29 November 2012, there was a breach of clause 3 of the Code of Conduct. MSD acknowledges that, for those Notices only, it did not first request the information or documents from Mr Thomas or give him a reasonable time to provide that information or those documents, as required by the Code of Conduct.

### [38]
In respect of Notices issued after 29 November 2012, MSD says it did comply with the Code of Conduct by sending a letter to Mr Thomas on 29 November 2012 seeking that information.

### [39]
Mr Thomas says, however, that there is no distinction to be drawn between Notices issued before 29 November 2012 and Notices issued after 29 November 2012. Mr Thomas says that as he never got the letter of 29 November 2012 there was non-compliance with the Code of Conduct in respect of all Notices.



#### Whether MSD Requested Information from Mr Thomas Prior to Issuing Notices
### [40]
As MSD has accepted a breach of the Code of Conduct for Notices issued prior to 29 November 2012, we are only required to determine whether MSD complied with clause 3 of the Code of Conduct in respect of those Notices issued after 29 November 2012.

### [41]
The letter of 29 November 2012 was sent to Mr Thomas at 221 Egmont Street, Patea. MSD submits that it understood that this was a correct address. There is no evidence that the 221 Egmont St address was provided by Ms Hawe. Ms Hawe was recorded as stating “Peter lives in Patea, Taranaki”, without providing any specific address.17

### [42]
For compliance with the Code of Conduct a duty can be inferred on the part of MSD to reasonably ensure that the address to which a request for information is sent is to an address of the recipient. This aligns with the duty imposed on MSD under IPP 8 not to use personal information without taking such steps as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which the information is proposed to be used, the information is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant and not misleading.18 The personal information used in this case was the (purported) address of Mr Thomas.

### [43]
The determination of the reasonable steps required to ensure personal information used is accurate could (depending upon the circumstances of the case) include who provided the information (which may include making judgements about whether the information requires verification) and the consequences should the information being used be incorrect.

### [44]
There is no evidence that on 28 November 2012 (the date of Ms Hawe's interview) MSD understood that Mr Thomas lived at 221 Egmont Street, Patea. Rather, MSD's records are that an investigation done in June 2012 showed that since 2008 Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe had a common address at Kew Place, Taupo and prior to that in Abraham Crescent, Palmerston North. There is also evidence of a recorded address for Mr Thomas at Maxwell Line, Palmerston North.

### [45]
MSD's records show that between 11 November 1991 and 29 July 1992, and again between 21 October 1993 and 27 June 1994 Mr Thomas had an address at 221 Egmont Street, Patea, but that was 18 years prior to the 29 November 2012 letter being sent.

### [46]
In addition, by the time the 29 November 2012 letter was sent, MSD had already conducted a significant investigation into whether Mr Thomas and Ms Hawe were married or living in a relationship in the nature of marriage. None of that investigation was in relation to 221 Egmont Street, Patea. From the information before the Tribunal, there was nothing in MSD's own records which indicated that Mr Thomas had lived at 221 Egmont Street, Patea during the past 18 years; in fact the records indicated to the contrary. Other than the letter of 29 November 2012, no correspondence was sent by MSD to Mr Thomas at the Egmont Steet, Patea address. None of the information sought in any of the Notices either before or after 29 November 2012 was, from the information available to us, in relation to 221 Egmont Street, Patea.

### [47]
The consequences of getting his address wrong were serious for Mr Thomas. If he failed to respond and to supply the information sought, MSD would then ask third parties to supply personal information about him. He would be unaware of the identity of those parties or of the nature of the information sought, the responses being requested to be given to MSD “in confidence”. Mr Thomas would be unable to mitigate the effects of those Notices.

### [48]
We find it was not reasonable for MSD to rely on Ms Hawe's information to send a letter to an address which MSD had no record of Mr Thomas living at for the past 18 years, without further checking. This is particularly because MSD's records disclosed a different address for Mr Thomas. We accept Mr Thomas' evidence that he did not receive the letter of 29 November 2012 and find that MSD did not, therefore, request the information from Mr Thomas before issuing the Notices to third parties. This is a breach of the Code of Conduct.

## MANNER OF COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION



#### The Law
### [49]
IPP 4 provides:

> **Information privacy principle 4**
>
> Manner of collection of personal information
> An agency may collect personal information only—
>
> (a) by a lawful means and; —
>
> (b) by a means that, in the circumstances of the case (particularly in circumstances where personal information is being collected from children or young persons), —
>
> (i) is fair; and
>
> (ii) does not intrude to an unreasonable extent upon the personal affairs of the individual concerned
>

### [50]
IPP 4 is based on the Collection Limitation Principle of the OECD Privacy Guidelines19 which provides that “there should be limits on the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and where appropriate with the knowledge or consent of the data subject”. The concept of fairness in IPP 4(b)(i) overlaps with the requirements of knowledge of, and consent to, the collection of personal information which are the subject of IPPs 2 and 3.



#### Whether information is collected by unlawful means
### [51]
IPP4 focuses on the "means” by which information was collected. In this case the means by which information was collected was the issue of the Notices. We find that the Notices, being specifically authorised by the SS Act, do constitute a lawful means within IPP 4(a).



#### Whether information is collected by a means that is unfairly or unreasonably intrusive
### [52]
MSD submitted:

#### [52.1]
The primary purpose of the fairness element in IPP 4 is to prevent people from being induced by unfair means into supplying information which they would not otherwise have supplied. The harm is aimed at the person supplying the information, not the person the information is about.20

#### [52.2]
Subject to compliance with IPPs 1 and 2,21 it was entitled to issue Notices in respect of Mr Thomas and the receiving third parties were obliged to respond.

### [53]
MSD also referred to R v Alsford.22 In that case, following anonymous information that certain properties were being used for cannabis cultivation, the Police asked a number of electricity companies about the levels of power consumption at those properties. One of the issues was whether the releases of information by the electricity companies were valid under the PA.23 In two of the requests made by the Police to the electricity companies there was a reference to alleged cannabis cultivation. In the third request there was merely a reference to a current investigation. The Court found that in the two notices which referred to cannabis cultivation there was sufficient information for the electricity companies to determine whether they could release the information in accordance with IPP 11(e). In the third notice (which did not refer to cannabis cultivation) the release of information was found not to be justified in terms of IPP 11(e).

*Citation: case - R v Alsford [2017] NZSC 42, [2017] 1 NZLR 710*

### [54]
The Supreme Court then considered whether the breach of IPP 11 necessarily meant that the Police obtained the information in breach of IPP 4 and determined that it did not necessarily do so:24

> **R v Alsford at [45]**
>
> As to whether the information was obtained by means that were "unfair” for the purpose of principle 4, it might be argued that because the breach of principle 11(e) resulted from the failure of the police to provide sufficient information about the reason for the request, they obtained the information by unfair means. We do not accept that, however. The police were entitled to ask for the information: objectively, their request was justified; if they had given a brief explanation of the type given in support of the other requests, the electricity company would have been entitled to conclude that they should supply the information under principle 11(e). In these circumstances, we do not see the police failure leading to non-compliance by the particular company as constituting unfair means....

### [55]
In relation to R v Alsford MSD said:

*Citation: case - R v Alsford*

### [56]
In R v Alsford it was held that Police were entitled to ask for the information sought. However, in this case the Code of Conduct required MSD to ask Mr Thomas for the information first, but this was not done.25 The distinction between R v Alsford and this case is that MSD (unlike Police) was not entitled to ask for the information sought from the third parties. It would only have been entitled to request that information if it had properly first approached Mr Thomas. Accordingly, R v Alsford does not support the MSD's actions.

*Citation: case - R v Alsford*

### [57]
Mr Thomas had not been given proper prior notice of the information sought nor the opportunity to provide that information, prior to third parties being approached. We have already found that breached IPP 2 (as codified in the Code of Conduct). We therefore consider that, in these circumstances, those Notices were issued in a manner that was unfair, in breach of IPP 4.

### [58]
For the sake of completeness, for the reasons set out at <sup>[57]</sup> above, we also find that the issue of Notices pre-dating MSD's letter to Mr Thomas of 29 November 2012 was done in a manner which was unfair, in breach of IPP 4.

## WHETHER THERE WAS AN INTERFERENCE WITH PRIVACY



#### The Law
### [59]
The Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant Mr Thomas a remedy only if he first establishes an interference with his privacy. Section 66 of the Privacy Act 1993 defines when such an interference is established.

*Citation: statute - Section 66 of the Privacy Act 1993*

### [60]
We have determined that there has been an action of MSD which has breached IPPs 1, 4 and 2 (as codified in the Code of Conduct). To secure a remedy Mr Thomas must, however, satisfy us that his privacy has been interfered with, in that the relevant actions of MSD:

#### [60.1]
Have caused or may cause him loss, detriment, damage or injury; or

#### [60.2]
Have adversely affected or may adversely affect his rights, benefits, privileges, obligations or interests; or

#### [60.3]
Have resulted in or may result in, significant humiliation, significant loss of dignity, or significant injury to his feelings.

### [61]
The issue of causation and the standard of causation required for an interference with privacy was considered in Taylor v Orcon Ltd:26

> **Taylor v Orcon Ltd**
>
> a plaintiff claiming an interference with privacy must show the defendant's act or omission was a contributing cause in the sense that it constituted a material cause. The concept of materiality denotes that the act or omission must have had (or may have) a real influence on the occurrence (or possible occurrence) of the particular form of harm. The act or omission must make (or may make) more than a de minimis or trivial contribution to the occurrence (or possible occurrence) of the loss. It is not necessary for the cause to be the sole cause, main cause, direct cause, indirect cause or "but for" cause. No form of words will ultimately provide an automatic answer to what is essentially a broad judgment.

*Citation: case - Taylor v Orcon Ltd [2015] NZHRRT 15, (2015) 10 HRNZ 458 at [61]*

### [62]
Causation was also considered in Heta v Ministry of Social Development.27 In that case MSD conceded that it had sent two Notices seeking information that had not previously been sought directly from Ms Heta. Despite this breach of IPP 2, the Tribunal determined that there had been no interference with privacy, as the humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings of Ms Heta were not caused by the breach, but by the fact that she was investigated and prosecuted for benefit fraud.28

*Citation: case - Heta v Ministry of Social Development*

### [63]
Mr Thomas needs only convince us that he has suffered one of the forms of harm referred to at <sup>[60]</sup>. The humiliation, loss of dignity or injury to feelings must however, be "significant".29



#### Submissions
### [64]
In relation to significant humiliation, significant loss of dignity, or significant injury to his feelings Mr Thomas says:

#### [64.1]
He was not being investigated for benefit fraud. The text of the Notice that read: "I am writing about Peter Thomas” and “to make sure we are making the right payments when people are receiving a benefit, we need to check some of the details they provided” was, however, a blatant attack on him and his veracity, and an attempt to undermine him completely in the eyes of his business suppliers.

#### [64.2]
As a result of the issue of the Notices his insurance company wanted to cancel his insurance and his finance company and mortgagee advised that without insurance they could not lend to him.

#### [64.3]
The meeting which he was required to attend with his insurance broker was humiliating and demeaning.

#### [64.4]
Likewise, the meeting which he was required to attend with his bank (which he says was threatening to cancel his overdraft facility and call up its mortgage) was humiliating and demeaning.

#### [64.5]
The fact that MSD contacted his business partners, accountants and insurers created a stigma on his reputation.

#### [64.6]
He and Ms Hawe still need to deal with MSD over ongoing care concerns for Ms Hawe's handicapped child. Such contact is always unpleasant, and Mr Thomas considers that he and Ms Hawe are belittled and made to feel humiliated and demeaned.

### [65]
MSD submitted that:

#### [65.1]
There is no causal link between the harm alleged and the Notices. Rather, the harm caused to Mr Thomas must have been caused by Mr Thomas' own conviction for dishonestly using documents to obtain carer support payments from the Ministry of Health. MSD relies on Heta v Ministry of Social Development.30

#### [65.2]
It is unlikely that any of the alleged responses from the organisations to which Notices were sent actually resulted in any financial loss or detriment to Mr Thomas.

#### [65.3]
The second element of s 66, being the causal harm, has not been met and, accordingly, there was no interference with the privacy of Mr Thomas.



#### Analysis
### [66]
While MSD relies on Heta, in our opinion that case is distinguishable from the present case. In Heta, MSD was investigating an allegation that Ms Heta was living with her partner of many years in a marriage type relationship, and so was not entitled to the (then) domestic purposes benefit. MSD had sent a letter to Ms Heta asking for information prior to issuing Notices. That letter omitted to say that any information was required in relation to Immigration New Zealand or Sky Network Television Ltd (Sky). Subsequently, MSD sent Notices to Immigration New Zealand and Sky. While there was an admitted breach of the Code of Conduct Ms Heta did not establish an interference with her privacy. The Tribunal concluded that the reasons for this included:

*Citation: case - Heta*

### [67]
By contrast in this case:

#### [67.1]
This was more than a minor breach of the Code of Conduct.

#### [67.2]
There was nothing to suggest that Mr Thomas would have been unable to supply information.

#### [67.3]
Mr Thomas' real complaint was that, on an objective reading, the Notices advised third parties (including ACC, his insurers, his bankers and his accountant) that MSD was investigating him in relation whether he was entitled to receive benefits.34 Unlike Ms Heta, Mr Thomas was not being investigated for benefit fraud.

### [68]
As a direct result of the issue of the Notices Mr Thomas was required to have interactions with his insurance broker and bankers. While Mr Thomas was able to resolve the issues with his insurance broker and bankers, having listened to his evidence we accept the considerable distress Mr Thomas said he felt when he became aware that organisations had received the Notices. We also accept that those interactions referred to at <sup>[64]</sup> above did cause him significant humiliation, significant loss of dignity and significant injury to his feelings. There has, accordingly, been an interference with his privacy.

## REMEDIES

### [69]
Where the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any action of a defendant is an interference with the privacy of an individual it may grant one or more of the remedies allowed by s 85 of the Privacy Act 1993:

*Citation: statute - s 85 of the Privacy Act 1993*

### [70]
Section 88(1) provides that damages may be awarded in relation to three specific heads of damage; pecuniary loss, loss of any benefit (whether or not of a monetary kind) and humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the aggrieved individual.35

*Citation: statute - Section 88(1)*



#### Declaration
### [71]
While the grant of a declaration is discretionary, declaratory relief should not ordinarily be denied.36

### [72]
The Tribunal sees nothing to justify withholding from Mr Thomas a declaration that MSD interfered with his privacy. This declaration is accordingly made.



#### Damages
### [73]
Before damages can be awarded for an interference with the privacy of an individual there must be a causal connection between that interference and one of the forms of loss or harm listed in ss 88(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Privacy Act 1993. The plaintiff must show the defendant's act or omission was a contributing factor to the alleged loss or harm, in that it constituted a material cause.37 In this case the potentially relevant heads of damage are loss of benefit and humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to Mr Thomas' feelings.

*Citation: statute - ss 88(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Privacy Act 1993*

### [74]
An award of damages is at the discretion of the Tribunal and damages are not accessed as of right.38 Any award under s 88 must be an appropriate response to the circumstances.



#### Damages for loss of benefit
### [75]
To award damages for loss of benefit, the Tribunal must be satisfied that the interference with privacy was a contributing or material cause to the loss of that benefit.39 The following principles are relevant:40

#### [75.1]
The benefit claimed may be monetary, but it is not required to be so.

#### [75.2]
There must be a causal connection between the interference in privacy and the loss of the benefit claimed.

#### [75.3]
The act or omission must be a material cause of the loss or harm.41

#### [75.4]
In a litigation benefit context, it is necessary for the plaintiff to establish the claimed benefit was one which might reasonably have been expected to be obtained but for the interference.42

### [76]
While Mr Thomas said that the Notices cost him a great deal of money, he did not supply any further details. He also said that he was able to persuade his insurance company, finance company and mortgagee that this was “simply a witch hunt by MSD” and that he was not being investigated for benefit fraud. In these circumstances there is insufficient tangible evidence of that loss of benefit and we accordingly decline to make any award to Mr Thomas for loss of benefit.



#### Damages for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings
### [77]
Mr Thomas seeks damages for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to his feelings. His evidence as to that humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to his feelings is set out at <sup>[64]</sup>.

### [78]
MSD says:

#### [78.1]
The true cause of any losses experienced by Mr Thomas was his conviction for dishonestly using a document in 2014.43

#### [78.2]
To the extent that the Tribunal considers an award of damages for injury to feelings and humiliation to be appropriate on the evidence, an award at the lowest end of band one in Hammond v Credit Union Baywide (Hammond)44 is appropriate.

### [79]
In Hammond it was noted that damages for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings are fact-driven and vary widely. Nonetheless, the Tribunal stated that awards fall into roughly three bands. At the less serious end of the scale awards have ranged upwards to $10,000. For more serious cases awards have ranged from $10,000 to about $50,000. For the most serious category of cases, it was contemplated awards could be in excess of $50,000.45 The Tribunal emphasised, however, that these bands are descriptive, not prescriptive and any award of damages must provide appropriate, not excessive, compensation in the circumstances of the case.46

*Citation: case - Hammond v Credit Union Baywide [2015] NZHRRT 6, (2015) 10 HRNZ 66 (Hammond)*

### [80]
The Notices issued to ACC on 14 January 2013 and 19 March 2013, to Westpac Bank on 6 May 2013 and to Onyx Finance Limited on 7 May 2013 only referred to Mr Thomas. We are satisfied that a reasonable interpretation of those Notices was that Mr Thomas was being investigated for benefit fraud.

### [81]
While Mr Thomas' evidence was that he was able to convince those parties that he was not being investigated we nevertheless find (for the reasons set out at <sup>[68]</sup>) that Mr Thomas did suffer humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings.

### [82]
In considering the amount of damages which should be awarded, we have taken into account that there has been a long and unhappy interaction between Mr Thomas and MSD, not all of which is related to the issue of the Notices. We are not awarding damages to Mr Thomas for anything other than his humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings suffered in relation to the issue of the Notices.

### [83]
Finally, in considering damages we must also take the conduct of MSD into account.47 In this case MSD did not comply with the Code of Conduct and over-reached when asking for certain types of information. Mr Thomas' view was that MSD would have been aware that there was no investigation into him for fraud, yet they deliberately failed to tell recipients of the Notices of that, leaving those recipients with the view that Mr Thomas was engaging in benefit fraud. Notwithstanding Mr Thomas' belief, we saw no evidence that MSD acted with malfeasance. On balance, the conduct of MSD was not such as to give rise to an increase in any award of damages.

### [84]
Overall, we are of the opinion that an award of an amount in band one of Hammond is appropriate. Accordingly, we award Mr Thomas $8,000 for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to his feelings.

## ORDERS

### [85]
The Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities there has been an interference with privacy and makes the following orders: 

 [85.1] A declaration is made under s 85(1)(a) of the Privacy Act 1993 that the Ministry of Social Development interfered with the privacy of Mr Thomas by breaching IPPs 1 and 2 (as codified in the Code of Conduct) and IPP4. 

 [85.2] Damages of $8,000 are awarded against the Ministry of Social Development under ss 85(1)(c) and 88(1)(c) of the Privacy Act for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to the feelings of Mr Thomas. Those damages are to be paid within six weeks of the date of this decision.

## COSTS

### [86]
Neither party has made detailed submissions as to costs.

### [87]
Since the decision in Commissioner of Police v Andrews48 the Tribunal has explicitly rejected the civil litigation rule that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay a reasonable contribution to the costs of the successful party.

*Citation: case - Commissioner of Police v Andrews [2015] NZHC 745, [2015] 3 NZLR 515*

### [88]
The Tribunal's current approach to costs broadly reflects this and is set out in Beauchamp v B & T Co (2011) Ltd49 where it was noted that across all three of the Tribunal's jurisdictions costs are not routinely awarded to the successful party and a notional daily tariff is seldom applied.50 The task for the Tribunal is to exercise a broad judgment based on the general principles identified in Director of Proceedings v Smith (Costs)51 and applied to the specific facts of the case52. In principle costs should not be awarded as a matter of course and, if awarded, the amount will usually be modest in nature.53

*Citation: case - Beauchamp v B & T Co (2011) Ltd (Costs) [2022] NZHRRT 30 (Beauchamp) at [15] and [16]; Citation: case - Director of Proceedings v Smith (Costs) [2020] NZHRRT 35*

### [89]
Bearing in mind the principles discussed at <sup>[87]</sup> and <sup>[88]</sup> above, unless the parties are able to reach agreement on the question of costs the following is to apply:

#### [89.1]
Mr Thomas is to file his submissions within 14 days after the date of this decision. The submissions for the Ministry of Social Development are to be filed within a further 14 days, with a right of reply by Mr Thomas within seven days after that.

#### [89.2]
The Tribunal will then determine the issue of costs on the basis of the written submissions without any further oral hearing.

#### [89.3]
In case it should prove necessary, we leave it to the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of the Tribunal to vary the foregoing timetable.
