## INTRODUCTION

### [1]
In January 2014 Mr Taylor (then a prisoner at Auckland Prison, Albany) sent a letter to Mr Hunter who then lived in Napier. That letter was withheld by the prison manager pursuant to the Corrections Act 2004, s 108 on the grounds it contained passages which could reasonably be construed as threats or attempts to intimidate the then Prison Manager, a former prisoner and police officers in the Hastings area.

*Citation: statute - Corrections Act 2004, s 108*

### [2]
On discovering the letter had been intercepted Mr Taylor requested that it be returned to him or that he be provided with a copy. His request was refused.

### [3]
Mr Taylor thereupon made a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner alleging a breach of IPP 6 which, subject to certain exceptions, provides for a right of access to personal information. The Commissioner found IPP 6 had been breached by the Department of Corrections (Corrections) and that there had been an interference with Mr Taylor's privacy.

### [4]
On 13 February 2015 Mr Taylor and Mr Hunter by joint statement of claim commenced proceedings before the Tribunal alleging Corrections had breached not only IPP 6 but also IPP 1 (purpose of collection of personal information), IPP 4 (manner of collection of personal information), IPP 9 (agency not to keep personal information for longer than necessary) and IPP 10 (limits on use of personal information).

### [5]
By letter dated 4 March 2015 the Privacy Commissioner gave notice to the Tribunal and to the parties that while the Commissioner had investigated the complaint as involving a possible breach of IPP 6, there were two difficulties with the Tribunal's jurisdiction:

#### [5.1]
The Commissioner had not investigated Mr Taylor's complaint under IPPs 1, 4, 9 and 10.

#### [5.2]
Although Mr Hunter had contacted the Commissioner's office to express support for Mr Taylor's complaint, Mr Hunter was not a party to the Commissioner's investigation. By email dated 10 September 2014 Mr Hunter had been informed he was not a complainant.

### [6]
By application dated 10 July 2015 the Chief Executive has sought orders striking out the claim as it relates to IPPs 1, 4, 9 and 10. The removal of Mr Hunter as a party to the proceedings is also sought.

### [7]
Mr Taylor by memorandum dated 14 July 2015 accepts the Privacy Commissioner investigated only an alleged breach of IPP 6 but submits the Tribunal can determine whatever principles appear relevant. Mr Taylor also drew attention to the fact that the same issues had arisen in another proceeding in which Mr Toia was the plaintiff and in which Mr Taylor had been a plaintiff but subsequently sought to be heard under the Human Rights Act 1993 (HRA), s 108. Mr Taylor invited the Tribunal to defer any decision in the present case until after the Toia proceedings had been determined.

*Citation: statute - Human Rights Act 1993 (HRA), s 108*

### [8]
Mr Hunter submits he is properly a plaintiff in these proceedings but if not, he has standing in terms of HRA, s 108 and should be permitted to intervene in the proceedings. The submission by Mr Taylor and Mr Hunter is that because the information in the letter had been intended for Mr Hunter he had an interest greater than the general public as to whether the Chief Executive had acted lawfully in withholding the content of the letter from Mr Hunter and from Mr Taylor himself.

*Citation: statute - HRA, s 108*

### [9]
Detailed legal submissions have been filed by the parties as well as by the Privacy Commissioner and the Director of Human Rights Proceedings.

### [10]
Because the twin issues of jurisdiction and standing were to be addressed in the Toia case and because Mr Taylor and Corrections were involved in that case (with the Privacy Commissioner also intervening to make submissions), a decision in the present proceedings was deferred until the decision in Toia had been delivered.

*Citation: case - Toia case*

### [11]
By Minute dated 24 August 2018 the Chairperson gave notice the decision in the Toia case would be published in the near future and once delivered, the parties in the present proceedings would be given an opportunity to file further submissions.

### [12]
The decision in Toia v Corrections (Jurisdiction) <sup>[2018]</sup> NZHRRT 46 was given on 30 October 2018. By Minute issued on 29 November 2018 the Chairperson gave timetable directions for the filing of further submissions by those involved in the present proceedings. Only the Chief Executive has taken advantage of that opportunity. His brief additional submissions were filed on 8 February 2019.

### [13]
To avoid unnecessary repetition it is not proposed in this decision to recite what was determined in Toia. That decision is adopted in whole. Our treatment of the issues will accordingly be abbreviated.

## WHETHER MR HUNTER HAS STANDING TO BE A PLAINTIFF IN THESE PROCEEDINGS

### [14]
As mentioned, once the Chief Executive had refused Mr Taylor's request for the return of the letter (or for a copy) Mr Taylor lodged a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner alleging an interference with his (Mr Taylor's privacy). Mr Taylor accepts the investigation which followed related only to IPP 6.

### [15]
It was only subsequent to the lodging of Mr Taylor's complaint that Mr Hunter on 29 August 2014 made contact with the investigating officer at the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. He did not complain about any interference with his own privacy. Instead he asked to be “joined” as a complainant to Mr Taylor's complaint. The relevant part of Mr Hunter's email follows:

> Under the circumstances I do not believe that this warrants a fresh complaint on my part but that rather I should be joined as a complainant in the existing matter.

### [16]
By email dated 10 September 2014 he was told by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner he (Mr Hunter) was not accepted as a complainant. See the Commissioner's letter to the Tribunal dated 4 March 2015:

> Second, although Mr Hunter contacted the Privacy Commissioner's Office to express his support of Mr Taylor's complaint, we informed Mr Hunter that he is not a complainant by way of email on 10 September 2014.

### [17]
For the reasons given in Toia at <sup>[56]</sup> to <sup>[86]</sup>:

*Citation: case - Toia at [56] to [86]*

### [18]
The insurmountable difficulty facing Mr Hunter is that he did not complain to the Privacy Commissioner about an interference with his (Mr Hunter's) privacy. He is not an aggrieved individual and has no standing to file proceedings or to ask the Tribunal for a remedy. It follows he must be removed as second plaintiff.

### [19]
It is now necessary to address Mr Hunter's application to be heard under HRA, s 108.

*Citation: statute - HRA, s 108*

## WHETHER MR HUNTER IS TO BE HEARD UNDER HRA, S 108

The statutory provision

### [20]
Section 108 of the Human Rights Act stipulates that certain non-parties may be allowed to appear before the Tribunal:

*Citation: statute - Human Rights Act, Section 108*

### [21]
This provision was first addressed by the Tribunal in Director of Human Rights Proceedings v Sensible Sentencing Group Trust (Application by Victims to be Heard) <sup>[2013]</sup> NZHRRT 26 at <sup>[17]</sup> to <sup>[20]</sup>. Using that decision as a starting point, our approach in the present case is as follows:

*Citation: case - Director of Human Rights Proceedings v Sensible Sentencing Group Trust (Application by Victims to be Heard) [2013] NZHRRT 26 at [17] to [20]*

Mr Hunter's application

#### Mr Hunter's application
### [22]
By memorandum dated 12 July 2015 Mr Taylor submitted Mr Hunter has standing in terms of s 108 because:

#### [22.1]
The information in the letter, in its entirety, was intended for Mr Hunter; and

#### [22.2]
Mr Hunter therefore had an interest greater than the general public as to whether the Chief Executive had acted lawfully in withholding the contents of the letter from Mr Hunter and subsequently, from Mr Taylor himself.

### [23]
By subsequent memorandum dated 17 July 2015 (supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Hunter on the same date) Mr Hunter adopted the submission made by Mr Taylor and explained his involvement in the case was necessary to demonstrate that Corrections (allegedly) “has a particularly poor attitude when it comes to compliance issues, particularly with respect to prisoner mail”. In his brief affidavit Mr Hunter referred to two alleged events which led to his gaining direct knowledge of Corrections officers mishandling prisoner mail.

### [24]
In the first event he allegedly witnessed a prison officer reading out aloud the content of an inmate's private letter to his girlfriend or wife. Other officers present allegedly made inappropriate remarks about what was being read out. In the second event it is alleged a prison officer swapped the letters and envelopes of outgoing prisoner mail so that the wrong letter would reach the wrong addressee. Mr Hunter says these are not isolated incidents and that he is aware of numerous other similar alleged incidents that demonstrate "an entrenched mindset, disrespect and regular privacy breaches".

### [25]
It can be seen the matters put forward by Mr Hunter do not relate to his status as the intended recipient of the letter but rather to alleged systemic irregularities in the handling of prisoner mail by Corrections.

### [26]
It is plain from Mr Hunter's application under HRA, s 108 that he and Mr Taylor intend expanding the scope of the present proceedings to address these broad and allegedly systemic issues regarding prisoner mail, issues which lie well beyond the question whether in this particular case IPP 6 was breached when Corrections intercepted Mr Taylor's letter addressed to Mr Hunter and then declined Mr Taylor's request for access to that letter.

*Citation: statute - HRA, s 108*

### [27]
For the reasons given in Toia at <sup>[95]</sup> to <sup>[96]</sup> the application under HRA, s 108 must be declined:

*Citation: case - Toia at [95] to [96]; Citation: statute - HRA, s 108*

### [28]
For the foregoing reasons we are satisfied the application by Mr Hunter under PA, s 108 should not be granted.

*Citation: statute - PA, s 108*

## WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE THE CLAIMS UNDER IPPS 1, 4, 9 AND 10

### [29]
The Tribunal has jurisdiction only over those matters investigated by the Privacy Commissioner. See Geary v Accident Compensation Corporation <sup>[2013]</sup> NZHRRT 34 at <sup>[58]</sup> to <sup>[64]</sup> and Director of Human Rights Proceedings [NKR] v Accident Compensation Corporation (Strike-Out Application) <sup>[2014]</sup> NZHRRT 1, (2014) 10 HRNZ 279 at <sup>[18]</sup> to <sup>[42]</sup>. The critical question is whether the Privacy Commissioner has in fact conducted an investigation into the matters that are to be the subject of a hearing in the Tribunal. See Edwards v Capital and Coast District Health Board <sup>[2016]</sup> NZHC 3167 at <sup>[44]</sup> and <sup>[57]</sup> and Mitchell v Privacy Commissioner <sup>[2017]</sup> NZHC 569, <sup>[2017]</sup> NZAR 1706 at <sup>[36]</sup>.

*Citation: case - Geary v Accident Compensation Corporation [2013] NZHRRT 34 at [58] to [64]; Citation: case - Director of Human Rights Proceedings [NKR] v Accident Compensation Corporation (Strike-Out Application) [2014] NZHRRT 1, (2014) 10 HRNZ 279 at [18] to [42]; Citation: case - Edwards v Capital and Coast District Health Board [2016] NZHC 3167 at [44] and [57]; Citation: case - Mitchell v Privacy Commissioner [2017] NZHC 569, [2017] NZAR 1706 at [36]*

### [30]
In the present case the Commissioner's Certificate of Investigation expressly stipulates that the matter investigated was the alleged breach of IPP 6. In his subsequent letter dated 4 March 2015 addressed to the Tribunal the Commissioner explicitly reaffirmed he did not investigate Mr Taylor's complaint under IPPs 1, 4, 9 and 10.

### [31]
The statement of claim does not explain how the alleged breach of these principles occurred and how it could be said they arise for determination in the context of a hearing into IPP 6.

### [32]
In these circumstances the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of those parts of the statement of claim which allege a breach of IPPs 1, 4, 9 and 10 either in relation to Mr Taylor or in relation to Mr Hunter.

## ORDERS

### [33]
For the foregoing reasons the Tribunal orders:

#### [33.1]
As Mr Hunter does not have standing to be a plaintiff in these proceedings, he is struck out as a party.

#### [33.2]
As Mr Hunter is not entitled to be heard under HRA, s 108, his application under that provision is dismissed.

#### [33.3]
As the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the claim that IPPs 1, 4, 9 and 10 have been breached by the Chief Executive, Department of Corrections either in respect of Mr Taylor or in respect of Mr Hunter or in relation to both, the allegations in the statement of claim relating to those principles are struck out.

## COSTS

### [34]
As this is a decision on interlocutory issues costs are reserved.

## FUTURE CONDUCT OF THE CASE

### [35]
The issues of standing and jurisdiction having been resolved, the Secretary is directed to convene a teleconference involving Mr Taylor and counsel representing the Chief Executive.

### [36]
It is assumed the Privacy Commissioner and the Director of Human Rights Proceedings have no further wish to be heard in relation to the surviving IPP 6 aspect of the case. If, however, that is not the case, notice is to be given to the Secretary on or before 4pm on Friday 5 April 2019. In the absence of such notification it will be presumed neither the Commissioner nor the Director wish to be heard further.
