## DECISION REGARDING COSTS

### [1]
This matter was set down for hearing on 20 March 2006. As our earlier decision records, the plaintiff failed to appear (see HRRT Decision 14/04, issued orally on 20 March 2006 in writing on 4 April 2006). The claim was struck out, and the defendant was given leave to apply for costs.

*Citation: case - HRRT Decision 14/04*

### [2]
By memorandum dated 22 March 2006 the defendant has applied for an award of costs.

### [3]
There has been no response from the plaintiff.

### [4]
For the reasons set out in our earlier decision, we are satisfied that the plaintiff was well aware of the arrangements that had been made for the hearing on 20 March 2006. All indications are that he simply chose not to appear. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that he ever made any attempt to contact either the Tribunal or the defendant to say in advance that he would not be attending the hearing.

### [5]
The net result is that the defendant has wasted a considerable amount of time and effort in preparing to defend the matter. Solicitor/client costs have come to just over $12,000. We accept that preparation for the case was complicated by the fact that the defendant was obliged to apply to the Court in order to have access to various documents that were or might have been relevant to the claim in the Tribunal. In addition, the matter was fully prepared for hearing. A witness was briefed. Submissions were written. Cross examination was prepared. As events transpired, the work was all done for nothing.

### [6]
Ms Marshall invited us to infer that the plaintiff must have known from as early as 15 December 2005 that he was not going to attend the hearing, because on 15 December 2005 he communicated to the Secretary of the Tribunal that he wanted all further correspondence to be sent to a post office box rather than the address he had been using up to that point. If we had been satisfied that the inference could fairly be drawn in the circumstances we would have awarded costs to the defendant based on a reasonable contribution to costs incurred prior to 15 December 2005, and on a full indemnity basis for all costs incurred after then. But we simply do not know what became of the plaintiff. While we can see the sense of Ms Marshall's argument, the fact that the plaintiff changed his mailing address does not necessarily mean that he had decided not to attend the hearing by then. We therefore decline to draw the inference Ms Marshall suggested.

### [7]
We do agree with Ms Marshall, however, that this case is very similar to the situation in Horne v Bryant (HRRT Decision 36/03; 18 December 2003), and that we ought to adopt the same general approach. But even acknowledging that preparation was complicated, we are inclined to think that $12,000 is too high a starting point for the assessment. After all, only one witness was briefed and the case itself was set down for a single hearing day only. Putting aside the possibility that there might have been some reason to depart from the general approach to costs after a hearing, if the case had gone to a hearing (and assuming the defendant were completely successful) costs would likely have only been within the area indicated in paragraphs <sup>[36]</sup> to <sup>[37]</sup> of the minority decision of the Chairperson of the Tribunal in Anderson v Claymore Management & Barclay (HRRT Decision 31/05; 1 November 2005).

*Citation: case - Horne v Bryant (HRRT Decision 36/03; 18 December 2003); Citation: case - Anderson v Claymore Management & Barclay (HRRT Decision 31/05; 1 November 2005)*

### [8]
We assess a reasonable contribution to the defendant's costs in this case at $4,500. We think that ought be uplifted by $2,000 to reflect the fact that the claim was abandoned without notice to the defendant.

### [9]
Pursuant to s.85(2) of the Privacy Act 1993 we therefore award costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant in the sum of $6,500.
