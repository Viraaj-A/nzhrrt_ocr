At issue in these proceedings is an allegation by the Director of Human Rights Proceedings (Director) that between 1 May 2012 and 7 October 2012 Mr Slater published on that website and on three others at least 46 documents containing personal information about Mr Matthew Blomfield, a business consultant who lives in Auckland. The documents were published as supposed justification for blogs written by Mr Slater for his website and in which he accused Mr Blomfield of dishonesty, theft, bribery, deceit, perjury and other criminal conduct. It was variously asserted Mr Blomfield was a “psychopath”, that he loves extortion and is a pathological liar. Another said “Drugs, fraud, extortion, bullying, corruption, collusion, compromises, perjury, deception, hydraulic-ing – its all there\". There was also reference to “a network of crooks\".",

Mr Slater does not dispute publication on the Whale Oil website or on www.scribd.com. Nor does he rely on any of the permitted exceptions to IPP 11.",

The Evidence Act applies to the Tribunal in the same manner as if the Tribunal were a court. See the Human Rights Act 1993, s 106(4). [12.2] However, under the Human Rights Act, s 106(1)(d) the Tribunal has an overriding discretion to receive any evidence which may, in its opinion, assist it to deal effectively with the matter before it, whether or not it would be admissible in a court of law: [12.3] Of this section the Tribunal in DML v Montgomery [2014] NZHRRT 6 (12 February 20214) at [50] and [51] stated: [12.4] Section 106 of the Human Rights Act applies to proceedings under the Privacy Act by virtue of s 89 of the latter Act. The Tribunal's approach to evidence in proceedings before it has most recently been explained in Taylor v Corrections (Admissibility of Evidence) [2016] NZHRRT 10 at [12] to [17] and in Taylor v Corrections (No. 2) [2018] NZHRRT 43 at [11] to [18]. No purpose would be served by repeating or summarising what is said there. It is sufficient to note that if there is any inconsistency between the provisions of the Human Rights Act, s 106 and any provisions of the Evidence Act, the provisions of the Human Rights Act prevail. See the Evidence Act, s 5(1). [12.5] Mr Slater wants the judgment admitted and the Director, if unsuccessful in opposing admission, also wants the judgment admitted for certain purposes. In these circumstances we can see no real prejudice to either party by admitting the High Court judgment pursuant to the Human Rights Act, s 106(1)(d) subject to all questions of weight. [12.6] In the context of the indistinguishable provisions of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006, s 239 the Full Court in Orlov v New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal [2014] NZHC 1987, [2015] 2 NZLR 606 at [78] to [80] held High Court judgments can be accepted by the New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal as evidence notwithstanding the Evidence Act, s 50. Thereafter it is a question of weight to be given to the conclusions contained therein. The decision in the present case to admit in evidence the judgment of Asher J is therefore supported by authority."

Of interest in the present context the Cairncross Review notes there are two areas of public-interest news that matter greatly. Both are essential in a healthy democracy. One is investigative and campaigning journalism, especially investigations into abuses of power in both the public and the private sphere. The second is what is described as the “humdrum task” of reporting on the daily activities of public institutions and the machinery of government and justice, particularly at local level, such as the discussions of local councils or the proceedings in a local court.

Remember Matt Blomfield also say he will pay more.\nIn this email trail below we can see that this whole arrangement was organised by Mike Alexander as a favour for a \"client\" ...who was \"in funds\".
