It is in this context we return to Ms Fisher's point about her belief that the Tribunal was the proper forum to which her complaint should be brought. Such belief resonates with the 'wider interest' referred to in Andrews and recognised in the cases cited above, particularly Lohr.",

Her failings are of a lesser degree than those evidenced in Apostolakis No. 3. She should not, however, feel encouraged by our decision. Any further proceedings against Dr Foster are likely to be met by an application by Dr Foster for Ms Fisher to pay her (Dr Foster's) legal costs in full. Access to courts and tribunals must be balanced against the desirability of freeing defendants from the burden of groundless litigation. See for example the analogous decision in Heenan v Attorney-General [2011] NZCA 9, [2011] NZAR 200 at [22].",
