The team involved a number of internal staff, external legal counsel and expert forensic accounting services, Indepth Forensic, of which Mr Parsons is the sole director. Mr Parsons is an experienced insolvency practitioner, a chartered accountant and has previous experience with complex company liquidations and bankruptcies.

                "content": "[3] Mr Henderson has been adjudicated bankrupt twice. His first bankruptcy was in 1996. He was discharged in 1999. His second bankruptcy in November 2010 arose from his failure to satisfy a judgment debt for $70,318.90 in favour of Havenleigh Global Services Ltd. That company was substituted as the applicant in a bankruptcy proceeding earlier commenced by another creditor Gold Band Finance Ltd with which Mr Henderson compromised a claim for $811,994.05. However, it soon transpired that these debts were minimal when compared to Mr Henderson's liabilities to others. Claims by third parties against his bankrupt estate exceeded $160 million. His final indebtedness was settled in the range of $100 million to $150 million.\n[5] The causes of Mr Henderson's bankruptcy were undisputed. He had assumed substantial liabilities through personal guarantees given to largely second-tier financiers for loans to various companies under his control. Mr Henderson undertook major property developments in Queenstown, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. He acted principally through Property Ventures Ltd (PVL), in which he was a major shareholder and later managing director. In late 2007 PVL and related companies under Mr Henderson's control started to experience difficulties in meeting debt repayment obligations which Mr Henderson had guaranteed. PVL's receivership followed in March 2010. The Associate Judge outlined in detail the nature and extent of Mr Henderson's personal guarantees for his companies borrowings.\n[6] There was a related cause for Mr Henderson's bankruptcy. He failed consistently to meet his personal taxation liabilities to the Inland Revenue Department. The Department claimed on his adjudication a total of $2,270,319.74 including penalties and use of money interest for years when Mr Henderson filed returns recording nil income and nil expenses. His companies also diverted PAYE and GST payments, for which they were legally bound to account to the Department, for their own purposes. Mr Henderson was responsible for this corporate misuse of taxation payments to finance various commercial developments. He applied public monies as private working capital.\n[7] Mr Henderson has an unusually active history in both the criminal and civil litigation. He has committed numerous offences under the relevant taxation legislation. Included among them are 25 convictions for PAYE offences entered on four earlier occasions and 12 convictions for other taxation offences on seven separate occasions. He has also been the subject of a number of money judgments in the District Court, High Court and the Taxation Review Authority. He has been a frequent appellant before this Court and the Supreme Court. The full details of Mr Henderson's litigation history are chronicled in the High Court judgment.\n[8] The Associate Judge's unchallenged findings on Mr Henderson's commercial history and conduct justify citation:\n[336] Mr Henderson carefully structured his personal affairs both before and in the decade following his first bankruptcy so as to have no assets. But he provided personal guarantees for huge sums. Consequently those creditors entitled to call on his guarantees would almost inevitably receive no payment on account of the guarantee if the company-borrower defaulted in adverse economic times. The distinct likelihood existed that a company-borrower would default in each of the many cases where the financier was a second-tier lender, usually lending for a short to medium term. The occurrence of an economic down-turn (as occurred with the GFC) was a predictable at least in terms of occurrence (if not in magnitude), and one for which a property development enterprise of substantial scale should have prepared. It was precisely in the event of a major economic downturn that second-tier lenders might not roll over loans; others might not step in to refinance the loans; the company borrowers would default; and Mr Henderson's guarantees would be enforced.\n[337] The fact that the Henderson companies embarked upon a programme of sustaining payments to financiers and suppliers at the expense of meeting Revenue obligations such as PAYE and GST masked for a period the onset of corporate insolvencies. The evidence is that Mr Henderson, as managing or sole director of key companies, was centrally involved in such decision-making. Those decisions increased what would have already been Mr Henderson's huge level of insolvency arising through his guarantees.\n[338] Furthermore, Mr Henderson was involved in company tax arrangements which led to personal tax liabilities. He received income for which he did not account to the IRD. The structuring of his personal affairs once again meant, that as those liabilities became confirmed through adjudication processes, he was insolvent on the basis of his tax liabilities alone.\n[Footnote citations omitted]",
