In our view the term “unwarranted” requires the Principle 6 right of access held by the requester to be weighed against the competing interest recognised in s 29(1)(a). In that exercise consideration must be given to the context in which the information was collected and to the purpose for which the information was collected, held and used. How the balance is to be struck in a particular case and a determination made whether disclosure of the information would involve the \"unwarranted disclosure\" of the affairs of another individual will depend on the circumstances. See Director of Human Rights Proceedings v Commissioner of Police [2007] NZHRRT 22 at [63]. In that decision the Tribunal at [64] made reference to some of the considerations which may be relevant when weighing the competing interests.
