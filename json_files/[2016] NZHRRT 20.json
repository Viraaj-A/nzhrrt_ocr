[Name of first plaintiff] complained about the Capital and Coast District Health Board's (\"the DHB\") collection and disclosure of her and her son's [name of second plaintiff's] personal information in 2013. She also complained the DHB failed to ensure the accuracy of the information before disclosing it to Child, Youth and Family. [Name of first plaintiff also alleged the DHB failed to respond appropriately to her request for correction.\n\n[Name of first plaintiff] raised issues under rule 6 in paragraphs 77 and 78 of her Statement of Claim in respect of a request made for information on 8 December 2015. We did not investigate these issues under principle 6 of the Act, and she did not bring up any rule 6 issues during our investigation.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider this aspect of the Statement of Claim."

Proceedings before the Tribunal are permitted by s 82 only where an investigation has been conducted under Part 8 or where conciliation (under s 74) has not resulted in settlement. For the reasons explained in that decision at [20] to [23], an important aim of the Privacy Act is to secure voluntary compliance with its principles and on receiving a complaint the Privacy Commissioner must attempt to reach a settlement between the parties. Only if those efforts fail can the matter proceed to the Tribunal. Following an adversarial hearing the Tribunal can award a wide range of remedies and substantial damages.",
