It seemed that a principal contention of Mr Dean was that SLP, being income-tested, was prima facie discriminatory. Mr Dean said that while all grounds of discrimination applied, in his case the prohibited grounds of discrimination most directly involved were sections 21(1)(b) (marital status), 21(1)(h) (disability) and 21(i)(k) (employment status) of the HRA.
