In this case, nothing about the conduct of Mr and Mrs Harvey exacerbated the emotional harm experienced by Ms Godfrey. There was no evidence of malice or of deliberately hurtful or offensive behaviour on their part.",

              "content": "The breach of s 53 in the present case consisted of a single incident rather than treatment over a protracted period as in Meulenbroek and McClelland. The loss was of a chance to rent the property rather than the rental of the property itself. Within approximately two weeks Ms Godfrey had secured alternative accommodation. We have accepted Ms Godfrey suffered emotional harm and was upset and angered by her treatment. However, we do not find that such harm was to the level established in Meulenbroek or Singh, neither were the consequences of the discrimination Ms Godfrey experienced protracted as in McClelland. We believe an appropriate response to what happened in the present case is an award of damages in the first band discussed in Hammond v Credit Union Baywide at [176]. We award $4,000 under s 92M(1)(c).",

He also submitted they could be distinguished from the defendants in Meulenbroek and McClelland in that they are not a large commercial enterprise but rather \"Mum and Dad investors\" operating four rental properties. We accept that Mr and Mrs Harvey are now well aware of the non-discrimination provisions of the HRA and their obligations under s 53.
