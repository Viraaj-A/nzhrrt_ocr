If anyone wants to order that quantity of hotpot for that price, there is no prohibition preventing any diner from doing so. Had Red Hill simply set out the price for hotpot, no exception could be taken. Any discrimination alleged is therefore merely theoretical and does not give rise to material disadvantage.",

Given Mr Zhang accepted it would be appropriate to charge some additional amount for an individual serving size of hotpot, Red Hill argued that Mr Zhang's principal complaint is about the amount he is required to pay, rather than about discrimination per se and is frivolous for this reason.",
