Although the defendants' memorandum dated 24 July 2002 refers to the plaintiff's having incurred approximately $22,500.00 costs, the Tribunal has taken that to be a mistake and these are in fact the defendants' costs. Of the $22,500.00 costs, $15,800.00 or so have been incurred since the issue of the proceedings in September 2001.",

His concluding submission is that costs should lie where they fall.",

That committee made a clear recommendation which the plaintiff elected to ignore. This is not to in any way dispute his right to bring the matter before the Tribunal but, had a greater degree of objectivity being employed, the subsequent election might not have been made.",

From a perusal of the accounts, there is no way of telling how many hours have been expended on this matter but there is a distinct impression that a few more hours were expended than were strictly necessary in the particular circumstances of the case. The number of witnesses and the resulting preparation of briefs was perhaps greater than was strictly required. The proceeding thus became more lengthy and protracted than it need have been.",
