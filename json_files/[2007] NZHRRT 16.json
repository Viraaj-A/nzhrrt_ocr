Although the Tribunal is not obliged to accept the opinion given by the Privacy Commissioner in any case, it ought to be obvious to such litigants that when their case comes to the Tribunal they will need to be prepared to deal with any adverse opinion by the Privacy Commissioner. To approach litigation in the Tribunal on the basis that the substantive matters raised in the Privacy Commissioner' opinion can simply be ignored is extremely unwise.” (at para 55).",

              "content": "We certainly agree with the defendant that it is entitled to an appropriate award of costs, and we reject the plaintiff's argument that costs ought to be left to lie where they have fallen. But we do not think it is appropriate to award costs on a full indemnity basis. We note:\n[a] The plaintiff says in effect that it was not until he was briefing his evidence that he was able to establish, in a way that he accepted, how the information at issue had come to the defendant. Prior to that he had been led by a third party to believe that the information at issue had not been passed by it to the defendant. That had given him reason to doubt the account of events offered by the defendant. But then after the claim was commenced, the third party had written to tell the plaintiff that its earlier advice had been wrong. A further search of records had established that it (the third party) was the source of the information that the defendant had received about the plaintiff after all;\n[b] We accept that the plaintiff issued the proceedings in good faith, in the sense that he genuinely believed that the account of events that had been offered by the defendant was incorrect. It does not follow that he was obviously right to issue the proceedings: the Privacy Commissioner's opinions had been to the effect that there was no breach of the Privacy Act irrespective of whether the identity of the source of the information was known or not. But the point is that this is not a case in which the plaintiff has simply refused to accept incontrovertible facts; we are willing to accept that when he issued the proceedings he held the view that his claim did have some prospect of success;\n[c] Furthermore we think it is clear that the plaintiff did the responsible thing to discontinue the claim as soon as it became clear to him that the factual situation was not as he had expected. As a result the defendant was not put to the expense of preparing evidence or readying itself for a hearing. The situation is not the same as one in which a plaintiff simply abandons a case on the eve of the hearing as in Horne v Bryant (supra - we also note that even in Horne v Bryant the Tribunal was not persuaded to award full indemnity costs). Indeed we think that a decision to award full solicitor/client costs in this case might set a counter-productive precedent; the wider interests of justice are against adopting an approach that might discourage others from acting responsibly to end a claim when it becomes clear to them that it no longer has any prospect of success.",
